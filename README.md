Welcome to my Portfolio!

In my 10 years of visual management in retail environments I have acquired the critical knowledge to break down complicated projects into smaller, manageable tasks. Throughout the years, I have seen how technology has rapidly embedded itself into the retail industry and this has inspired me to broaden my horizons. By combining my previous experiences with my software skills, I aspire to design creative ways to attract clients and promote growth within an established company.
